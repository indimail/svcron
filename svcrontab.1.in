.SH NAME
svcrontab \- maintain svcrontab files for individual users (based on Vixie Cron)

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsvcrontab\fR [ \fB\-u\fR \fIuser\fR ] \fIfile\fR
.br
\fBsvcrontab\fR [ \fB\-u\fR \fIuser\fR ]
[ \fB\-l\fR " | " \fB\-r\fR " | " \fB\-e\fR " ] [ -d dir ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsvcrontab\fR is the program used to install, deinstall or list the
tables used to drive the \fBsvcron\fR (8) program. These tables are present
in @crondir@ directory. You have three kinds of tables. One is the
@syscrontab@ file. Then you have the spool directory @crondir@/@spooldir@.
Each user can have their own crontab in the spool directory. You can also have
crontab files in @syscrondir@ directory.

Apart from the above, any user can create, list, delete crontab files
anywhere specified by \-d argument.
.PP
If the \fI@crondir@/cron.allow\fR file exists, then you must be listed
therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the
\fI@crondir@/cron.allow\fR file does not exist but the
\fI@crondir@/cron.deny\fR file does exist, then you must \fBnot\fR be
listed in the \fI@crondir@/cron.deny\fR file in order to use this command.
If neither of these files exists, only the super user will be allowed to
use this command.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 3
\fB\-d\fR \fIdir\fR
This option allows you to create user crontabs in \fIdir\fR. With this
option \fBsvcrontab\fR relinquishes setuid privileges, if the setuid bit is
set on \fBsvcrontab\fR binary.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR \fIuser\fR
Specifies the name of the user whose svcrontab is to be tweaked. If this
option is not given, \fBsvcrontab\fR examines "your" svcrontab, i.e., the
svcrontab of the person executing the command. Note that \fBsu\fR (8) can
confuse \fBsvcrontab\fR and that if you are running inside of \fBsu\fR (8)
you should always use the \fB\-u\fR option for safety's sake.

The first form of this command is used to install a new svcrontab from some
named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ``-'' is given.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR
display current svcrontab to be displayed on standard output.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
remove current svcrontab.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
edit the current svcrontab using the editor specified by the \s-1VISUAL\s+1
or \s-1EDITOR\s+1 environment variables. After you exit from the editor,
the modified svcrontab will be installed automatically.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
svcrontab(5), svcron(8)

.SH FILES
.nf
/etc/indimail/cron/cron.allow
/etc/indimail/cron/cron.deny
.fi
.SH STANDARDS
The
.I svcrontab
command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX''). This new command syntax
differs from previous versions of Vixie cron, as well as from the classic
SVR3 syntax.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command
line.
