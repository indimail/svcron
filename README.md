# Vixie Cron

*The **[Cron]** flavor that runs on most systems.*

<br>
<br>

This version of **Cron** is functionally based on <br>
**System V**'s implementation and thus allows <br>
every user to have their own **CronTab** file.

</div>

## ðŸ“‘â€…â€…Crontabs

All crontab files are stored in a read  
protected folders atâ€…â€…`/var/spool/cron/crontabs`â€‰

<br>

## ðŸ“œâ€…â€…At

**There is no direct support forâ€…â€…`at`**

However as long as your system  
supports it, you can still useâ€…â€…`atrun`

<br>

## ðŸ“‹â€…â€…Logging

A message will be logged for every  
command that is run by a CronTab.

<br>

## ðŸ›¡â€…â€…Access

You can control access to theâ€…â€…`crontab`  
command by utilizing theâ€…â€…`allow`â€…â€…and  
`deny`â€…â€…files inâ€…â€…`/var/spool/cron`

*The command is used to install crontabs.*

<br>

## ðŸ“ºâ€…â€…System V

While it hasn't been tested yet, some effort <br>
has gone into making porting to it easier.
