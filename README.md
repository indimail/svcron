# Vixie Cron

**Cron** based on **Vixie Cron** that can load crontabs from any directory.

</div>

This version of **Cron** is functionally based on **Vixie Cron**'s implementation and thus allows every user to have their own **CronTab** file. **Cron** has been modifed to work with [supervise](https://github.com/indimail/indimail-mta/wiki/supervise.8). It goes without saying that you could use it without **supervise**. This version of cron, renamed as **svcron**, allows you to have crontabs in any directory. Similarly, the **crontab** command has been renamed as **svcrontab**, allowing you to edit crontabs in any directory. You are not restricted to hard coded, semi-configurable directories like <u>/var/spool/cron</u>. Both **svcron** and **svcrontab** have an additional <b>-d</b> argument to pass the crontabs directory as an argument. **svcron** can be started by **supervise**, with the appropriate command line, when it finds a directory named <u>crontabs</u>, in any of the service directories, configured under [svscan](https://github.com/indimail/indimail-mta/wiki/svscan.8). Additionally the service directory name is treated as an <u>user</u> in the <b>passwd</b>(5) database. If you create a directory named **crontabs** in any of such directories, **supervise** will run **svcron** as user <u>user</u> with the crontab files in **crontabs** sub directory. e.g. If you want to have a supervised service **rotate_logs** runs every day at midnight as user <u>root</u> -


```
# mkdir /service/root/crontabs
# echo "58 23 * * * svc -a /service/*/log" > /service/root/crontabs/root

You can also use svcrontab(1) to modify the crontab
# svcrontab -e -d /service/root/crontabs
```

Few of the standard I/O functions have been replaced by [substdio](https://github.com/indimail/indimail-mta/wiki/substdio.3) interface from [libqmail](https://github.com/indimail/libqmail), fixed size arrays replaced with [stralloc](https://github.com/indimail/indimail-mta/wiki/stralloc.3) variables, The plan is to replace everthing with functions from **libqmail**.

Standard Binary Packages will be made available for RPM/ArchLinux/Debian based systems using Open Build Service.

The changes to supervise are yet to be made and published. Watch out this space for updates. There are still few things to be ironed out (mostly security concerns) and testing.
